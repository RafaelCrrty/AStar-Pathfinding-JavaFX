A program was designed to plot points on an interface to interconnect them and draw graphs, applying the star algorithm a starting point and an end point are defined, the star algorithm or *A, searches for the shortest path to reach the final destination, which colors the points in another color, to indicate the path that was identified as the shortest among all the points intertwined with each other.
JavaFX was used with SceneBuilder, to create the graphical interface, using design patterns it was possible to make updates to the interface, using singleton and mediator.

Java SDK 17.0.2
